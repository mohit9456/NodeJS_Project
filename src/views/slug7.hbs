        <p class="pb-2 pt-4 card-titler w-75">Hello, <br /> Recently Microsoft rolled out its new Windows 11 on 5 October. If you don’t know about the features of Windows 11, then you can check out this blog. So, this blog is solely for those who want to upgrade to windows 11.<br /> <br />

Despite being the latest version of Windows, I don’t think you should upgrade to Windows 11 right now. Windows 11 has been optimized for good productivity and also packs with a Good UI design. I heard some news where a user said: <br /> <br />

“A Dell XPS 13 just felt slower, despite its 10th-generation Intel processor and 8 gigabytes of RAM. Even when I closed Slack, which was eating RAM like a hungry hippo, the computer still wasn’t as peppy as it was on Windows 10. If your older computer is still running smoothly on Windows 10, you might think twice before upgrading!” <br /> <br />

If you still dare to upgrade to Windows 11, then here’s the official method to do so.</p>
